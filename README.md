# jareds-password-generator

## Description

This application is a random password generator made with starter code that was given to me. I added the necessary functions and debugged the existing javascript file so that the program will run properly with no errors. Now when the "generate password" button is clicked, the user will be given a set of prompts on how long they want the password to be and what characters to include. The program will then generate a random password with the given information.
